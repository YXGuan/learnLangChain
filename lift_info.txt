WHO WE ARE We exist to see students made fully alive in the hope of Jesus by being the church on every campus. Everyone Sent to Multiply Everything The core value of LIFT Church Our Story  How we LIVE These values come from what we read about the early church in Acts 2:42-47 How we reach the campus Through a movement of Simple Churches,  we will train and send disciple-makers to new campuses in new cities around the world. Slowly but surely, we will see a Simple Church on every campus. We believe we will see 10 churches on 10 campuses by 2026 (http://www.liftchurch.ca/vision-10x26/)  as a result of a multiplying discipleship movement.    How we Disciple These five discipleship emphases provide a framework to make disciples info@liftchurch.ca
